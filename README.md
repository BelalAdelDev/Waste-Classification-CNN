# Waste-Classification-CNN
A deep learning solution for automatic classification of waste images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), leveraging TensorFlow/Keras and transfer learning through EfficientNetB0.

***

## Project Overview

This project trains and evaluates a CNN model to classify images of waste into six classes: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash. It uses image augmentation and leverages transfer learning with EfficientNetB0 pretrained on ImageNet. The notebook includes training, evaluation, metrics reporting, and inference demonstrations.[1]

***

## Dataset

- The dataset should be organized in subfolders under `train`, `val`, and `test` for each class inside a root directory (default: `content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Garbage/`).
- Sample distribution in notebook:  
    - Train: 1766 images/6 classes
    - Validation: 377 images/6 classes
    - Test: 384 images/6 classes[1]
- Supported image formats: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`.

## Installation

```bash
# Recommended environment: Google Colab with GPU, or a local setup with Python 3.x
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python
```

***

## Usage Instructions

1. **Prepare Data:**  
   Organize your dataset as described above. Update the notebook path variables if needed.

2. **Model Training:**  
   - Run the notebook to mount Google Drive (for Colab) and set up dataset paths.
   - Adjust parameters like `IMG_SIZE` (default: 384x384) and `BATCH_SIZE` (default: 32).

3. **Transfer Learning:**  
   - EfficientNetB0 model is loaded and frozen for initial training.
   - Fine-tune specific layers after primary training.

4. **Training Callbacks:**  
   - Early stopping
   - Learning rate reduction upon plateau

5. **Evaluation:**  
   - Metrics include accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and classification report (precision, recall, F1-score per class).
   - Example on test set: overall accuracy ~93%.[1]

6. **Model Saving/Loading:**  
   - Model is saved as `.keras` format after training.
   - To predict a single image, load model and preprocess image as shown in the notebook.[1]
